      <description>the truth of the youth My favorite Shakespeare book is Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet because they both grow up in the end. Childhood is the greatest practical joke that all the embittered adults like to take part in. They make up this fantasy world of lollipops (the big round swirly ones) and Peppa Pig and shelter us from the real world of work parties and genocides and such and then with curfew and chores they charge rent like the evil landlords that they are.</description>

      <description>some woman lore Historically menâ€™s perspective of women in literature could be one of three things:
Goddesses
Fetishized
Worthless
In Greek mythology Artemis, Athena, Aphrodite are beautiful and powerful women with men trailing at their feet. The female heroines of Shakespeare: Desdemona, Cordelia, and Hermia were strong-willed and brave. Or perhaps Madame Bovary and her promiscuous ankles clad in little black boots that click-clack down the hallways. But irl the average woman is only useful for reproductive purposes and household duties.</description>
