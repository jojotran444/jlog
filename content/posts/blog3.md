I pack my sparkly vomit green  thermos in my bag and then I take the 8:00 am shuttle bus to school every morning. I like to take the stairs to the cafe on the second floor, there's something about elevators, waiting for the light to ding, herding into an enclosed space; it makes me queasy. I feel the same about stoplights. Vomit green grandma loveseats crowd the floor. I have to get on my toes to pick the best apple in the basket. It's always a second floor apple for breakfast; I went to a fruit store and the fruit store apple was not as good as the second floor apple, so I only eat the second floor apples. I choose the prettiest apple, the reddest and the shiniest one. My first grade teacher told me they put wax on apples to make them look more attractive and I think that is when I became a fatalist. I'm at the front of the line. On cold mornings I like to order a flat white. On hot mornings I also like to order a flat white. You see it's about the viscosity and also iced drinks melt and leave condensation on your desk and weird water marks on your Chinese homework. It's extremely important. I dig out my stamp card from my bag. 


I spend most my time in the library. But only the left side. That's where the books are, that's where the real library is. The right side is just desks and dividers and computers and harsh fluorescent lights and many more people who have to do people stuff like walk around and literally sledge hammer their fingers into their keyboards and occasionally make other humanly noises. No, the other side is the good side. Warmer, yellow lights, (though the floor is more squeaky), less desks therefore less people, and actual books. Not many books, not Yale library book collection, but I suppose it'll do. I bee line for the good table, my table. Pros: natural light, low foot-traffic, corner table. Cons: no air vent, only, one charging port, mysterious stain on the seat. Right leg over left leg. I open my book.


I typically take the 10:30 pm shuttle bus back. And so for amount of time I spend silent in the library all day, one might expect, that I did my homework. The thing is, I don't. You see I like to tell myself, and yes I do squint while deeply contemplating, that I don't like to do things when people tell me to do them. So I start reading about The Anatomy of Robots by Despina Kakoudaki. You see they told me to choose a major, my mother told me to choose business. I feel like I generally think an appropriate amount of thoughts however I don't really like to do any inner reflection, it just makes me feel a little bit terrible. So here I am burdened with rubbish coursework when I could be reading about how the creation of artificial people have affected society through literature and cinema. "The aspiring human does not become a God, and the artificial person does not really become a human" (Kakoudaki). It's 11:10 am, I have to get to Chinese class. 


After B1 cafeteria lunch food, I go back to the library, morning nonfiction reading is over. Now I would like to read The Plague by Albert Camus. I know exactly how they're feeling! I'm currently struggling through the coronavirus! "But since he, personally has learned what it is like to live in a state of constant fear, he finds it normal that others should come to know this state." (119 Camus). Sometimes it gets too quiet in the library. I leave my stuff at the desk and grab my ID card. By around 5:00 or 6:00 pm I like to listen to The Strokes and go on my daily stomp outside. I typically walk at least a few miles in an arbitrary and undetermined route. Sometimes I'll sit on a nice park bench. I saw a little boy riding on his bike. It was funny because his bike was just as little as he was. 


I go back to the library. I want to read something else now. I'm a woman, let's read about feminism, "- killed herself one winter's night and lies buried at some cross-roads..." (48 Woolf). It's 10:20 pm I need to get to the last shuttle bus, I like to sit by the window. After I drop my stuff in my room I realize I'm hungry again. I go outside to walk some more. I text Gabe. Gabe never sleeps and he likes to make sheeple jokes. We find a noodle shop. The ranking is 1.) soupless noodles 2.) any form of rice 3.) noodles in soup. This has been popularly agreed upon. It's 12:15 am and I'm a little tired now.
