### some woman lore
Historically men’s perspective of women in literature could be one of three things:

1. Goddesses

2. Fetishized

3. Worthless

In Greek mythology Artemis, Athena, Aphrodite are beautiful and powerful women with men trailing at their feet. The female heroines of Shakespeare: Desdemona, Cordelia, and Hermia  were strong-willed and brave. Or perhaps Madame Bovary and her promiscuous ankles clad in little black boots that click-clack down the hallways. But irl the average woman is only useful for reproductive purposes and household duties. They are weak, emotional, and dreadfully unintelligent.


Well anyways now with a proper hierarchy established, society may finally develop. Victoria Woolf writes: it's not only that women are inferior, it’s that men are superior. 
“Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size. Without that power, probably the earth would still be swamp and jungle” (Woolf).

How could man justify colonization, racism, slavery, genocide, and war if they were not dominated by a superiority complex? These violently unjust behaviors may have developed the tall skyscrapers and innovation of the modern age, however what does a society built on flawed foundations represent? 


Today, it is no longer socially acceptable to be openly misogynistic or sexist, therefore women have been subjected into strange little puzzles beyond any logical or rational comprehension. 

“We knew finally that the girls were really women in disguise, that they understood love even death, and that our job was merely to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them.” (Eugenides). 

They're chronically sad or obsessed with spending money. They have fickle hearts and hoard strange crystals. Surely these mythical creatures are so fundamentally different that they cannot operate at the same capacity as men. Well humor me, (it's funny because women aren't funny), what if, perhaps we are not actually that much different than men. That a woman could have the same capabilities and sexual desires as a man!


What is different are the gender roles that society (more on that later...) implements. If a woman doesn’t use makeup, do her hair, play dress-up, she is automatically perceived as less feminine, however if a man were to wake up and do the bare minimum he is no less and no more masculine! Am I denying that I enjoy coordinating my outfits or buying star-shaped hair clips? NO. It is incredibly fun, maybe if men tried doing so, the world would be better! Maybe the default font in Google Docs wouldn't be Arial. Maybe Harambe never would have died. Anyways the point is for however smart and superior men seem to be, women still seem very hard for them to understand. 

### misstery
It’s like how Westerners stereotypically view Chinatown. An area of jarred snakes and other peculiar oddities that are so strange they’re not even worth trying to understand. In mystery thriller Chinatown (1974), Jake witnesses a woman, whom he had just learned was raped by her father and had to bore and raise the child, get accidentally shot in the head by the police. The officer says, “Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown." This overgeneralization of east asian cultures as absurd and strange has translated into futuristic fetishization in cyberpunk. Cities of the inexplicable like Blade Runner (1982) features foreign Japanese characters to enforce the strangeness of the environment. 

What was I talking about? Oh right, women, I forgot about them.


So basically modern sexism is the overgeneralization and oversimplification of women, labeling them as nonsensical and absurd and incapable of understanding. So how does the modern man imagine the life of a woman?

### manic pixie dream girl
“She’s not like other girls.” This is the ideal fantasy girl for the typical introverted and antisocial male type. She’s richly charismatic and vibrant. She understands my humor and laughs at my jokes. She’s my perfect complement therefore she is obligated to reciprocate my passionate and all-consuming feelings. Think Summer in 500 Days of Summer (2009), Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), or Samantha in Her (2013). They are figurines fabricated from the ill-conceived and superiority complex perspective of men.
